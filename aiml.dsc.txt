INSIGHTS:
i have gone through the insight of the datasets
       while analysing analysing about single variabe(UNIVARITE) individually it decalre about students performance
which they compare that with their daily day practises like parttimejob,hourspent,iq etc which may affect 
their scoring capability like age factor contibutuing to spending less time on stufy rather than concentrating 
on work, rather certain factor like IQ boost their link on studying smart etc 
	These data usualyy talks about thinngs to improve on specific persons result cause it tells us the exact lacking point 
of it.

bivariate:
	analysing about it, according to mr it decides about interlinking of data proporsional to prodectivity cause,
most young guys may not have parttimr jobs but better IQ so thinking in that vision they can acheive easily they just 
want to worry about time they spend so i can conclude that their proposion of time between each data is to be smart to 
achive their plan.

MULTIVARIATE:
	it discuss about a conflict on data ,which have strong zone as well as the opposite that it people who ignore their
weekness and strong in their zone never fail with a big failure, personall intrest plays a role where habeing a part time job
doesnt even mater with respect to age so this datas and their capabilities are always interliked in every way.

*i dont really good with jupitornotebook whichinvoles python so i dont have ideas about patters and trends to potrait on them.
